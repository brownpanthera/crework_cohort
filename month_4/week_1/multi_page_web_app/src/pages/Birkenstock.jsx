                <p>The BIRKENSTOCK Arizona is a genuine classic. Modeled on the cork sandal, this version is made from EVA. The high-quality, odor-neutral EVA has been tested for harmful substances and combines numerous positive attributes. It is ultra lightweight, highly elasticated, waterproof, skin-friendly and offers the comfort you have come to expect from BIRKENSTOCK. The swirl of colors really catches the eye. Thanks to the creative production process during which EVA particles are heated and then melt, no two pairs are the same. The product and the distribution of colors can thus differ from the photo.</p>
