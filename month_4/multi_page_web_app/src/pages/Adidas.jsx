                <p>Acclaimed British designer Craig Green has made a name for himself as a fashion visionary by transforming what is familiar into a new, transcendental experience. His latest collection presents a new iteration of adidas' most sophisticated icon: the Stan Smith. The unmistakable leather upper is still crafted with classic perforated details and colours, but is updated with an amphibious-looking sole and scuba-inspired tooling. Cords and tension continue the story of past collections, decorating the tongue and heel and wrapping around the upper.</p>
